I am a senior at Wellesley College majoring in Data Science. I have a strong passion for data engineering, machine learning, and AI. I am enhancing my skills through the Break Through Tech AI (BTTAI) program at Cornell Tech, a one-year intensive that provides hands-on training in data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

With proficiency in Python, Pandas, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and machine learning models, I aim to leverage data and technology to drive impactful societal development, especially for communities in need. I am dedicated to building solutions that make a measurable difference, combining technical expertise with purpose-driven innovation.

When I'm not diving into data, youâ€™ll find me traveling, solving puzzles, exploring new cuisines, or getting lost in a good novel
